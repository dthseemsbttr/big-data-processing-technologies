For one thing, it seemed too sweet. It may be that the recipe requires unsweetened coconut, but I wasn&#039;t sure and what seems most easy to find in grocery stores is sweetened. If you use sweetened coconut I would recommend decreasing the amount of sugar you add. The other problem was that my pie wasn&#039;t as firm as the restaurant&#039;s version. I used liquid eggwhites but couldn&#039;t find a good conversion chart for the 7 eggwhites the recipe calls for. I used a cup of the liquid eggwhites and it was too much. Last but not least, a homemade crust probably tastes best. I used a frozen shell and my pie was just so-so.&lt;br/&gt;At the restaurant this pie is served with both whipped cream and sliced bananas on the top. Since my pie was a little sweet, sprinkling nutmeg and/or cinnamon on top of the bananas seemed to help cut the sweetness a little and complimented the pie nicely.',\n",

I usually bring a mac and cheese to Thanksgiving dinner with my family, but last year I was given the task of the potatoes.  I always get rave reviews for my mac, and it was no different here.  However, this time I had people asking if THEY could take home the left overs. Hah!  So, well done.  Thanks for a great recipe.  BTW, I'll be doing the mashed potatoes again this year, and SO looking forward to it.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I've never had Panera soup, but this recipe makes a delicious soup. Only changes I made were 2 cloves of garlic sauted with the onion, whole milk instead of half/half, and I only added about five ounces of cheese as opposed to eight. Seemed like 8 ounces was a bit much for such a small volume of soup. The soup thickened up beautifully. Creamy and thick without being overly rich. For those who complain that this has no flavor, I am baffled. My first guess is lack of salt. The soup does require a good bit of salt and pepper, but that's the nature of any recipe. You salt as you go, and add as much as you think it needs to bring out the flavor. My second guess is using a bland supermarket cheese. I used a good quality cheddar from Trader Joe's. Not expensive at all, but way more flavor than the bland rubbery stuff. I will definitely be making this again.\",\n",

This is the first recipe I have come across that tasted like hers.  I have made it a couple of times now.  I follow the recipe except most of the time I don't use any stock.  The first time the only red wine I had was Marsala.  I was concerned that it might be too sweet but really liked how it came out and use it every time.  This recipe is time consuming but like someone else suggest using carrots already shredded really helps.  I don't like instant mashed potatoes but sometimes buy some already made at deli.  I always use ground lamb which is more authentic than beef.  It shocks me that some people think it's bland.  Mine is anything but.  This is quickly becoming one of my favorite recipes to make.\",\n",

I used the smallest egg I had.  I only added two tablespoons of ice water.  I turned down my AC.  I kept returning everything to the fridge.

However I make it slightly differently: I replace coconut liqueur with marsala (I use All'uovo Bookmark Crema - I'm not really sure how any of these words relate.. but it's what's on the bottle :) It's also VERY cheap AU$7 a bottle here). Marsala is used in Tirimisu.<br/>Instead of wrapping up the sauce mixture and banana in alfoil (I find it leaks and doesn't fully cover the bananas), I put it all (excluding the bananas) into a small saucepan (a 14.5cm one is perfect for one) and add about 1 tsp of all spice. Leave the banana out to start with and mix the ingredients over low-med heat until it starts foaming and the sugar has dissolved. Chop up the bananas into ~2cm rounds and add it to the sauce mixture and stir for a bit, then let it bubble slowly over low heat. Once the banana is soft it's done and you can take it off the heat.<br/>Pour over a stack of two-three pancakes and drop some vanilla icecream balls on top and you'll be in heaven!<br/><br/>PS. Also tried with gluten free flour (not sure what grain) and dairy-free butter (Nuttelex) and it was also amazing!\",\n",

(In fact, I just checked, and it's still there .. 1 Avenue Charles Koecklin, 83820 Rayol-Canadel-sur-Mer, France). We arrived late in the evening, and past eleven, were served the only remaining offering from the kitchen, Fish Soup. This was the most classic type, with large slices of dried crusty bread offered beside gargantuan garlic cloves. On Sunday past (2012), I woke up with such a craving for this soup...and stumbled upon your recipe.<br/><br/> we read the recipe in a hurry and mistakenly boiled the onions, tomatoes and garlic in HALF a LITRE of OLIVE OIL. once we realized our mistake, i have to admit we were quite worried; but with the price of olive oil, we decided not to start over and simply continued...<br/><br/>We couldn't find monk fish at the local grocery store, but, I assure you, this soup was so authentic and satisfying, even with our flub up, that I was whisked back to Rayol Canadel and will definitely keep this one to impress my friends who might otherwise turn up their noses at the sound of 'fish soup' (yes, admitedly, i have some of those).<br/><br/>thanks!\",\n",

I let them rise for longer than 10 minutes, only because I had lots of other things going on in the kitchen so they had to wait their turn for the oven. I reduced the oil as recommended by other reviewers, and reduced the sugar a bit but they are still way too sweet for my Australian tastes as a hamburger bun, so I&#039;ll drop the sugar back more next time. Making 12, you do end up with slider size, but as they&#039;re quite soft I think they&#039;d fall apart as burger rolls if they were bigger - so sliders is fine by me.

Instead of chopped bell peppers in the filling. I used chopped serrano chillies. We like our food very hot!\\n3. I Added 2 teaspoons minced garlic to the filling.\\n3. After baking, I topped with a spicy maraneria sauce and Mozzarella cheese and placed back into thr oven until the cheese was melted.\\n\\nI FINALLY got cudos from my guy for my cooking. He said it was the best I have cooked to date. Usually he throws away my left overs... Tonight he packed the left overs for lunch tomorrow!\\n\\nThank you for your help!',\n",

Originally I was going to make rolls out of this (for some reason the kids will eat homemade bread more readily in roll rather than loaf form), but it just screamed great big rustic loaf to me, so that is what I did, one great big free form loaf. I will divide it in two loaves next time (think it might rise higher that way), but I could not have asked for a more beautiful bread. The crumb was so moist. The flavor was awesome, it smelled divine. I have found another new bread to love, and love it I shall. I will most definitely be making this frequently.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Wow! Followed recipe basically, but changed a few things. Mixed apples into the brown sugar mixture. Used homemade challah bread, dried a bit in the oven. Layered bread, raisins plumped in orange juice, egg mixture, then apples on top. I like my french toast moist, and I thought this would keep it moister. It turned out gorgeous. Would be perfect to serve to company or for a holiday breakfast. Is a bit more like a bread pudding, but we loved it. Could also serve it as dessert. I topped with a syrup made of maple syrup, peanut butter, and orange juice. Awesome together and if you like peanut butter, give this a try. It would make a good dip, and kids would love it.',\n",

I did not have any apple sauce so I took a can of light syrup peaches, drained half the syrup out then hand mashed them to a pulp. They mash easily and had a consistency like apple sauce. I also used pecans instead of walnuts because that is what I had on hand. This was DELISH! they had a great rise and wonderful flavor. They were also very moist. You could not taste peach in them at all :) Thanks Mizz!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I am rating this for the cinnamon rolls.  My daughter is allergic to eggs and soy, and I was looking for a hamburger bun recipe suitable for her.  I saw this recipe and while I am going to make the hamburger buns, I immediately wanted to make the cinnamon rolls.  I had previously been unsuccessful in finding a cinnamon roll recipe that didn&#039;t have eggs (that I felt compelled to make).  I got my bread machine out last night as my husband was cooking dinner.  I warmed the milk to about 110 degrees and then proceeded with adding the rest of the ingredients.  90 minute later I was rolling out my rectangle of dough (and very excited).  I spread a half a stick of butter (maybe a little less) over the dough and then I spread 1 cup of brown sugar mixed with 2 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon over the butter.  Patted it down and very gently put my rolling pin over the surface.  I rolled them tightly and cut them at least 1 3/4 inches (I tried dental floss cutting, but went with my sushi knife instead).  I placed them cut side down in two round foil pans.  One pan got wrapped and put in the freezer.  The other pan I wrapped and put in the refrigerator.  Before I went to bad, I turned on the oven light and set the pan of cinnamon rolls in the oven (do NOT turn on oven).  This morning, they were ready to bake when I got up.  I put together a frosting (2 oz cream cheese, 7 tbls butter, 2 tablespoons milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar).  These were AMAZING.  My daughter is over the moon happy (which makes me happy) and my husband said they were awesome as well!',\n",

I did find that 1 tsp. of salt was quite a lot, so next time, I'll use half that amount. Also, since I can't seem to leave well enough alone...I added a bit ( maybe 1/8 tsp.) of ground cloves, and 1/2 cup of raisins to the batter.  They smelled deliciously spicy, and ready, before the 20 minute baking time was up, so I'd suggest keeping an eye (and nose) on them.  I always fill muffin tins nearly-to-the-brim with batter, and I was rewarded with 10 very generous muffins. My friends will love getting some of these...to enjoy with their coffee or tea!  Of course, I'm saving a few for myself!... Grammy Bunny\",\n",

After sauteeing the onions, peppers, garlic and spices, I moved them to a bowl.  Then cooked up the pumkin and curry paste.  After 5 minutes added the onions and pepers back in and continued with the dish. Managed to also reduce the total amount of oil to 1 tablespoon by using some extra vegetable stock to soften the onions.  Used fresh tomatoes but think this would work equally well with the canned variety. My final tweak was that I used a very ripe plaintain instead of the banana, a simple matter of availability and preference for cooking with plantains as they hold there shape a bit better.  Will certainly make this soon as it was thoroughly enjoyed.  Imagining variations with small amounts of chicken in lieu of some of the chickpeas, or a light addition of allspice.

       "  'review': \"I made this Jello salad in a Bundt pan and brought it to a Labor Day picnic.  Everyone was thrilled at the postmodern irony inherent in the Jello mold, plus they all thought it was delicious.  This recipe was just a smidge too big for a 12-cup Bundt pan, so I ended up with about 2 cups of extra Jello in custard cups.  If I do it again, I'll probably do just one package for the top layer (since that's the skinniest part of the Bundt pan).  The very first layer didn't glom on well to the middle layer and as the salad warmed up on the table, the top slid slowly off in slow-motion jiggly lime-green avalanche, which was hilarious.  If you're going to try this in a mold, and you prefer structural integrity to hilarity, I recommend that you start mixing the center layer a bit before the first layer is firm, and add the second layer exactly at the 2-hour mark. I sprayed my pan with non-stick cooking spray, and it just warmed up naturally on the way to the picnic, and it unmolded beautifully.  A fun recipe!  Thanks!\",\n",

I did a bit a research and managed to approximate it by combining white potatoes, sweet potatoes and a healthy rutabaga.  I'm not sure how authentic that was, but I do know that we had a lovely dessert this past Friday night.  I used soy milk because I did not want to make the dessert dairy.  I served this with some custard on the side.  Thanks for submitting this to the tag game, I'm glad I had a chance to try it out!\",\n",

It was an easy recipe to fix and then toss in the crockpot to cook for the day.  I did sub some ingredients but don't feel that it changed the flavor.  I didn't have any tomatoe sauce so I used a small can of tomatoe paste, a 101/2 oz can of beef broth that was double strength.  I didn't drain anything just opened cans and tossed in the crock.

The problem was the baby oil and the amount of it. I had quite a bit of oil sitting on top of the sugar after I mixed it all together. When I used the scrub in the shower it made the tub very, very slippery. My skin felt very smooth and nice after the shower but I had a hard time getting the oily film off of me. I didnt see in the directions a set time to let this sugar scrub sit and maybe soak up some of the oil so not sure if I should have let the scrub sit for a day or two. If the oil problem was cleared up this would be a nice scrub. Sorry this didnt work out the best for me. :( Thank you for sharing Chef # Rachal Ray Fan.

This is a myth that keeps getting perpetuated and was debunked countless times, most famously on Cooks Illustrated: &quot;Letting steaks sit at room temperature before cooking does not raise their temperature enough to prevent a band of gray meat from developing below the crust.&quot; If you want uniformity, it is better to perform the reverse sear method, which is essentially the exact opposite of the method described in this article. You start the meat in a low temperature oven first, with a thermometer. Bring it up to about 118 degrees F and let it rest for 5-10 minutes, the meat will continue to cook about 2 to 3 degrees after you have taken it out. The final step should be searing 2-3 minutes on the hottest your pan can handle and then finally another 10 minutes of rest. You will have the juiciest, perfectly cooked medium rare steak with a nice crust.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Wonderful, and easy. Nothing else to add. -- posted Apr 1, 2004 Update: I have made this so many times since I have posted my review! I came back tonight (while my meat is browning to make yet another go-round) to make sure I had given this five stars (I had). This recipe is so versatile. I have made it with onion powder & garlic powder, and even no onion at all - I prefer the original, although I now cut my onion *very* small since my kids are picky onion-haters. ;) I have also, at various points on my low-carb journey, used Sweet & Low Brown, Splenda with a dash of blackstrap molasses, and plain Splenda. Again, I prefer the original, but these substitutes are do-able. (I don't recommend leaving the brown sugar out entirely - I did once, and it just didn't have the right balance of flavors.) I usually don't find that my sauce stays thin. It usually cooks down and caramelizes beautifully.  I have found that it doesn't do that when I double the recipe, and I don't like the result as much, so I try to use 2 pans to double this. I usually use pork country ribs. I guess that's about it, except to profusely thank MaeEast for posting such a wonderful recipe!  \",\n",

I also used ginger powder since I find ginger root to be a bit too strong.  It turned out great. Served with brown rice and steamed brocolli. Will definitely be making this again!\",\n",

It looked great after the initial baking, but it turned out gooey and chewey after the cool down.  Still, I put it together and while it' wasn't the best looking dessert I've ever made, it was tasty.  I agree with Chef Jean that the Nutella was a great addition!

I used white onions instead of red, and used beef brisket instead of skirt steak.  (Because of that big change, I grilled it over lower heat, for a longer time, until medium doneness.)  I also added the salt and cumin directly into the marinade, only because (oops!) I scanned the directions too quickly and that's what I thought it said to do.  I used Fat Tire for the beer.  Also, I didn't use chipotle hot sauce because my kids think it's too spicy, but used a similarly flavored ancho sauce that has the same kind of smokiness but less heat.  All that said and done, this is one OUTSTANDING marinade!  The meat was delicious!  My husband and kids gave it a resounding 5-stars, said they thought it broke the scale and ought to have been 6 stars.  Thanks, bobo!  Made for PAC Fall 2008.\",\n",

I added some minced garlic, some chopped pine nuts and a couple of drops of freshly squeezed lemon juice but otherwise made these exactly to the recipe.  The wonton wrappers were extremely easy to work with, and I'll certainly be using them again and experimenting with other fillings. My only warning would be: don't try to overfill them.  I knew with my tendency to err on the side of generosity with ingredients  such as spinach and prosciutto that I love I'd probably need more than the specified number of wonton wrappers, and I did!  I served these topped with Recipe #121093 with a couple of other dishes to my lunch guests and they clearly loved them and also loved the fact that these were reasonably low-fat.  I had used a low-fat ricotta for that reason as I find that low-fat varieties of white cheeses in no way compromises the final dish.

(I think the BF would have just eaten the sauce with a spoon if I'd have let him!) The ingredient quantities and directions are right-on.  I did have to use baked chips instead of regular tortilla chips because I forgot to buy them at the store.  Turned out great, but BF and I agreed that regular tortilla chips would have been better.   Oh well!  Next time - and there will be a next time!  Thanks so much, Rollin'!  Reviewed for PAC Spring 2009.\",\n",

I misread the instructions as I was making this dish and added all 3/4 cup of Cool Whip to my cheese/peanutbutter mixture.  So I just put dollops of the jelly (I used strawberry instead of grape) on top of the pie with some peanuts (please see photo, if interested).  I used the standard Keebler Graham pie crust, and there was way too much filling for my crust - I could have easily filled 2 pie crusts.  I don't know exactly what happened.  I just over-filled my pie crust with the filling as I didn't want to waste it and I didn't have another crust.  Maybe this is supposed to be over-filled?  As there was so much filling, it took much longer to set than 30 minutes.  But it was really good.  Made for Photo Tag.\",\n",

I used recipe #9186 for the brownies, fresh strawberries, Best Choice French Vanilla pudding, and Best Choice non-dairy whipped topping.  I also didn't have a clear bowl, so I layered this into individual bowls, one of each other layers (except the choc shell... I didn't once over the strawberries and once over the pudding/whipped cream mix)  This was so yummy!  I love the burst of tartness from the strawberries.  The texture of the pudding and whipped topping went very well with fruit and crumbled brownie.  The shell hadn't set up hard but was just firm.  The whole thing was very much a delight.  I made a whole recipe which was likely a mistake my waistline will grow to regret, but DH liked it enough that this may not be too much of a problem.  Thank you for the keeper recipe!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I made these, and was worried that they would not hold together as another reviewer stated. I could not get them to clump together like traditional crabcakes, so I just mashed them into the pan (make sure you use metal- my silicone bakeware did not work, but that was my fault, not the Chef's), and hoped for the best. After baking, I just turned the hot metal pan over on a platter, and they all fell out and looked almost like real crabcakes (but the shape of a muffin cup). I did not have quite enough fresh crab on hand, so I supplemented with some diced salad shrimp- no problem at all! I mixed Valdalia and green onion, and used fresh dill and lemon juice. The combination of stronger spices surprised me, but, we all ate the crabcakes (crab/shrimp cakes), and there were no leftovers! They were such a hit, that I made them again two nights ago, but used leftover salmon since I was still out of crab, and because of this recipe, also out of shrimp. It's a great concept, and one I will be using again and again! As a bonus, the entire house smelled like some wonderful, exotic dish. I had my oven hood on to draw some of the heat outside, and neighbors were asking what I cooked. I gave them this website for the recipe, so I can bet that Chef Garlic will be getting many more reviews before too long! <br/><br/>As an aside, I always make this lemon, dill pickle juice and onion sauce (really watery, but sorta like a tarter sauce flavor, without the mayo), when we have any sort of seafood. It makes up great on the seafood, as a pasta base, marinade, or for a sandwich the next day. But, nobody touched it when I made this recipe. My feelings were hurt about that, but it did save me some work, as I hate chopping. <br/><br/>Also, make sure you use mayo, and not that other stuff with a blue lid that doubles as a salad dressing. The sugar in the M.W. would make it way too sweet. Maybe use regular stuffing mix if you use M.W.? But, I really liked the flavor of the cornbread stuffing with the contrast of the seafood. <br/><br/>In addition, the recipe says that it makes one serving, but, we had 4.8 adults that ate from it. The 0.8 is because one is due to deliver in about 3 weeks. I'll cut the recipe in half, or perhaps freeze part of it when the extra 2.8 people go home after she gives birth. <br/><br/>Overall, I have been impressed with this recipe, and pleasently surprised by how well everyone enjoyed it. Having to please 3.8 other picky adults, I felt this was a winner since there was nothing left either time. The flavor is much stronger than any crabcake I have ever had, but with the cornbread, it was a lot more distinctive, too. If you use metal muffin tins, and just press the back of the spoon down hard on top of the muffin tin, there will be no worries about them not holding together. One high dollar famous crabcake maker on the Chesapeke had crabcakes that did not stick together as well as these, and we always go back there a few times a year because they are so good. I have found that using a local farm's organic eggs over commerical grocery store varieties seemed to help keep the cakes together. My old go to recipe for crabcakes usually fell apart all the time <br/><br/>As a personal tip, I enjoyed the ones where I only filled the cup about 1/2 way full, as they came out tasting more like the fried version since more area was able to be baked. They were amazing, and you could taste all of the flavors seperately, and melding together. Mmmm, I want them again after writing this review!\",\n",

But that is just my personal taste.\\n\\nSecond,  I did not like the roasted garlic, plain garlic to me had a much better flavor.\\n\\nThird, I preferred shitakis, vs white mushrooms, it gave a much deeper flavor which I thought was needed.\\n\\nPersonal experience, using a Qtip can get fibers from the tip on the wonton.  I use my finger to moisten always.\\n\\nSpraying the steamer, I use a bamboo steamer, you may just want to clarify that. A bamboo steamer doesn't need to be steamed as some teflon coated ones don't need either.\\n\\nLast ... Clarify the difference between Shanghai wonton wrappers and regular wrappers.  Shanghai wrappers do not have egg in the dough whereas a regular wonton wrapper does. They do have a bit of a different taste and they are not as easily found.  They are only available at my Asian Market whereas all my grocery store carry wonton wrappers.\\n\\nBut overall a nice flavor and thx for sharing\\nKim\",\n",

I used 3 chicken sausages with artichokes, half of a good sized butternut squash for the 2 of us and made the recipe as stated, except I only has fresh sage so I used dried rosemary and thyme. This seemed to work very well though I will try it with all fresh herbs next time. This is a very easy meal to make. I served it with polenta and a salad of baby greens topped with avocado & dried cranberries, Thank you Geema for a tasty recipe.',\n",

       "  'review': \"This is a great recipe, my bread turned out just as described, non-dense non heavy, light and fluffy just like store bought whole wheat bread! I followed the recipe exactly, ended up adding 4 cups of whole wheat flour to the dough. Tips for beginners like me - to determine how much flour is enough, your dough should not stick to your hand or countertop, it should peel away from the side of mixing bowl or your hand but still feel a little sticky.  If the dough sticks, add some more flour.  I knead the dough in Kitchen Aid stand mixer at speed 2 for 10 minutes.  another tip for beginners, when kneading your dough in the Kitchenaid mixer, your dough should form a ball/balloon hooked on the hook, moving with the mixer hook, and it should look like a balloon been squeezed between the walls of the mixer bowl and the hook.  For warm water, I used 110F degrees for both sponge and dough. When baking, when the temperature inside the bread reaches about 190-200 degrees it's ready.

WAY too sweet! This is probably not Nanita's fault. I guess I should have stopped to think for 1 second that if my yams were canned in SYRUP, they would need less than a whole 1/2 cup of sugar in the recipe, but who has an extra second to think on Thanksgiving Day? Also, I think the bottom layer of sweet potatoes was too mushy as it didn't get sufficient exposure to the heat. This would probably be solved if I used fresh yams, or spread the canned yams out over two baking dishes in 1 thin layer to thicken with the heat. I won't be making this again, so guess I'll never know.\",\n",

I can see that there is the potential for many variations (add sausage, sprinkle with herbs, sauces, etc). My husband really loved it--he took a bite and pronounced it \"the perfect food.\" I won\\'t say how many he ate--just that I had to make another bunch! UPDATE: Almost 1 1/2 years after I first made this, it remains a favorite with my DH. I cook his for 15 minutes for a more custardy yolk, and mine and DS\\'s for 20 minutes for well-cooked yolks. Here\\'s a tip: I find that a gravy ladle works better than a spoon for mashing the tater tots into the muffin tins.',\n",

       "  'review': 'DEEEELICIOUS! I loved it! It filled our house with a comforting aroma. I took a picture before we ate it, and my mouth was watering. The steaming bowl was just sitting under my nose tempting me to eat it first and take a picture of whatever was left. Luckily I was able to hold out. <br/>I chose the crock pot method, but I added the cumin in the begining (by accident) with everything but the sour cream. Also, I added more cilantro (a weakness of mine), broth and red peppers. I added a few dashes of chili powder to add a little spice. I chose to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I put them in whole and frozen & broke them into bite-size pieces right before I added the sour cream.<br/>When I did add the sour cream in the last half hour, I only added half of what the recipe calls for. I added the remainder as dollops in each bowl, garnished with some more chopped cilantro.<br/>We made biscuit nuggets (recipe to be posted shortly) and dipped them in the soup. AWESOME combo!<br/>I have 3 daughters and they all loved it! My 11 y.o. asked if she could take some to school for lunch the next day, adding \"if there\\'s any left over\". My 3 y.o. decided she liked to scoop the soup with the cooked onions as if they were chips and dip (she\\'s never liked onions before) better than she liked eating it with a spoon. And my 2 y.o. was speechless. She was too busy chowing down to talk!  I\\'d say that\\'s 5 stars from each of us.<br/>Thank you sooo much for sharing this recipe! I will be making this again. And again. And again.',\n",

Of course, mine may have been more so b/c I doubled the recipe and used Barilla Plus elbows, and their box is 14 oz (or 14.5), so it was slightly less mac than called for. I would do that again to ensure sauciness! I did take other reviewers advise and reduced the flour a bit... again b/c I like a saucy mac and cheese.  So, I used 1/8 cup per batch (1/4 cup, since I doubled it). I also increased cheese by about a cup -- b/c I wanted to use up all my half packs of grated cheese... I don't think this was necessary, and I wouldn't insist on doing it again (though extra cheesy is always fine, too!!) Otherwise, I added more spice to it - I actually put in a bit of cumin and ground red pepper into the butter. And I mixed in some hot sauce when all mixed up, as well. It was really delicious!!!

I love Thai, and I love peanut sauces, and this one is a keeper, I also loved how tender the chicken was after being cooked in coconut milk! I topped it with some fresh coriander, which worked great! I was unable to buy any spinach on the day I wanted to cook this, so I just served it in bowls with some brown rice.  The only problem i had with it was I thought there was way too much fish sauce. I had to double all the other sauce ingredients (except the sugar)to get rid of the overpowering fishy taste. Next time I make it, I will only add 1-2 TB of each of the fish sauce & brown sugar. I recommend anyone trying this recipe to just add the fish sauce gradually until you have the taste you like. Great recipe though, and definately one I will make again!

It made the most sense to me to add the brown sugar to the pumpkin, spices and salt in step 5, so I added it there.  I'm glad I had all the ingredients pre-measured (as you suggested) otherwise I would have missed adding the sugar altogether.  The filling didn't seem to set completely, which may have been a result of covering the entire pie with aluminum foil while it was baking (which I opted to use because I don't have a crust shield). Your method of baking the pie shell for fifteen minutes really helps maintain a perfectly flaky bottom crust!  I will definately buy a crust shield and continue using this method in the future.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"We used boneless skinless breasts and did not marinate, but otherwise followed the instructions exactly.  I found a couple unexpected surprises from cooking this dish.  First, the thinner chicken breasts were much more juicy and tender than the thick ones.  Ultimately, the areas that were immersed were tender and juicy.  The areas on top that were sticking out of the sauce were dryer but still had good flavor.  The flavor was very pronounced without marinating and my younger kids had a little trouble with the different flavors.  We did serve this over rice.  The first couple of bites I was thinking that I would cut down the five spice to 1/4 tsp next time because that flavor was a little overwhelming, the next couple of bites I was thinking Wow..I'm not a orange zest fan at all but every bite I had with it was better than the bites without. So, I give this a big thumbs up and it will definately be something I will make in the crockpot next time and I will make sure the chicken is covered next time and up the zest and cut back a little on the five spice.  This rocked! Thanks for the recipe, Pamela.\",\n",

If you use sweetened coconut I would recommend decreasing the amount of sugar you add. The other problem was that my pie wasn&#039;t as firm as the restaurant&#039;s version. I used liquid eggwhites but couldn&#039;t find a good conversion chart for the 7 eggwhites the recipe calls for. I used a cup of the liquid eggwhites and it was too much. Last but not least, a homemade crust probably tastes best. I used a frozen shell and my pie was just so-so.&lt;br/&gt;At the restaurant this pie is served with both whipped cream and sliced bananas on the top.

This is the first recipe I have come across that tasted like hers.  I have made it a couple of times now.  I follow the recipe except most of the time I don't use any stock.  The first time the only red wine I had was Marsala.  I was concerned that it might be too sweet but really liked how it came out and use it every time.  This recipe is time consuming but like someone else suggest using carrots already shredded really helps.  I don't like instant mashed potatoes but sometimes buy some already made at deli.  I always use ground lamb which is more authentic than beef.  It shocks me that some people think it's bland.  Mine is anything but.

I used the smallest egg I had.  I only added two tablespoons of ice water.  I turned down my AC.  I kept returning everything to the fridge.

(In fact, I just checked, and it's still there .. 1 Avenue Charles Koecklin, 83820 Rayol-Canadel-sur-Mer, France). We arrived late in the evening, and past eleven, were served the only remaining offering from the kitchen, Fish Soup. This was the most classic type, with large slices of dried crusty bread offered beside gargantuan garlic cloves. On Sunday past (2012), I woke up with such a craving for this soup...and stumbled upon your recipe.<br/><br/> we read the recipe in a hurry and mistakenly boiled the onions, tomatoes and garlic in HALF a LITRE of OLIVE OIL. once we realized our mistake, i have to admit we were quite worried; but with the price of olive oil, we decided not to start over and simply continued...<br/><br/>We couldn't find monk fish at the local grocery store, but, I assure you, this soup was so authentic and satisfying, even with our flub up, that I was whisked back to Rayol Canadel and will definitely keep this one to impress my friends who might otherwise turn up their noses at the sound of 'fish soup' (yes, admitedly, i have some of those).<br/><br/>thanks!\",\n",

I let them rise for longer than 10 minutes, only because I had lots of other things going on in the kitchen so they had to wait their turn for the oven. I reduced the oil as recommended by other reviewers, and reduced the sugar a bit but they are still way too sweet for my Australian tastes as a hamburger bun, so I&#039;ll drop the sugar back more next time. Making 12, you do end up with slider size, but as they&#039;re quite soft I think they&#039;d fall apart as burger rolls if they were bigger - so sliders is fine by me. Overall, they were easy and the result is light and tasty.',\n",

I served this for dinner last night with Chicken & Lime Soup #3768, and they complimented each other nicely. Originally I was going to make rolls out of this (for some reason the kids will eat homemade bread more readily in roll rather than loaf form), but it just screamed great big rustic loaf to me, so that is what I did, one great big free form loaf. I will divide it in two loaves next time (think it might rise higher that way), but I could not have asked for a more beautiful bread. The crumb was so moist. The flavor was awesome, it smelled divine. I have found another new bread to love, and love it I shall. I will most definitely be making this frequently.\",\n",

Would be perfect to serve to company or for a holiday breakfast. Is a bit more like a bread pudding, but we loved it. Could also serve it as dessert.

I saw this recipe and while I am going to make the hamburger buns, I immediately wanted to make the cinnamon rolls.  I had previously been unsuccessful in finding a cinnamon roll recipe that didn&#039;t have eggs (that I felt compelled to make).  I got my bread machine out last night as my husband was cooking dinner.  I warmed the milk to about 110 degrees and then proceeded with adding the rest of the ingredients.  90 minute later I was rolling out my rectangle of dough (and very excited).  I spread a half a stick of butter (maybe a little less) over the dough and then I spread 1 cup of brown sugar mixed with 2 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon over the butter.  Patted it down and very gently put my rolling pin over the surface.  I rolled them tightly and cut them at least 1 3/4 inches (I tried dental floss cutting, but went with my sushi knife instead).  I placed them cut side down in two round foil pans.  One pan got wrapped and put in the freezer.  The other pan I wrapped and put in the refrigerator.  Before I went to bad, I turned on the oven light and set the pan of cinnamon rolls in the oven (do NOT turn on oven).  This morning, they were ready to bake when I got up.  I put together a frosting (2 oz cream cheese, 7 tbls butter, 2 tablespoons milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar).  These were AMAZING.  My daughter is over the moon happy (which makes me happy) and my husband said they were awesome as well!',\n",

I did find that 1 tsp. of salt was quite a lot, so next time, I'll use half that amount. Also, since I can't seem to leave well enough alone...I added a bit ( maybe 1/8 tsp.) of ground cloves, and 1/2 cup of raisins to the batter.  They smelled deliciously spicy, and ready, before the 20 minute baking time was up, so I'd suggest keeping an eye (and nose) on them.  I always fill muffin tins nearly-to-the-brim with batter, and I was rewarded with 10 very generous muffins. My friends will love getting some of these...to enjoy with their coffee or tea!  Of course, I'm saving a few for myself!... Grammy Bunny\",\n",

After sauteeing the onions, peppers, garlic and spices, I moved them to a bowl.  Then cooked up the pumkin and curry paste.  After 5 minutes added the onions and pepers back in and continued with the dish. Managed to also reduce the total amount of oil to 1 tablespoon by using some extra vegetable stock to soften the onions.  Used fresh tomatoes but think this would work equally well with the canned variety. My final tweak was that I used a very ripe plaintain instead of the banana, a simple matter of availability and preference for cooking with plantains as they hold there shape a bit better.  Will certainly make this soon as it was thoroughly enjoyed.  Imagining variations with small amounts of chicken in lieu of some of the chickpeas, or a light addition of allspice.

       "  'review': \"I made this for my daughter and SIL's wedding reception.  Because I'd made so many other dishes, I cut this by 1/3, but I shouldn't have done so.  Everyone really liked it, two platters of it were cleaned, and I had many requests for the recipe.\\r\\nThis is something that I'll make a lot, including to have available around here as a breakfast jam...mmmm!!.  I did add a bit more allspice and added some cinnamon.  The red jalapenos look gorgeous in this mixture.  I also used two bags of frozen peaches, thawed and didn't puree, just let everything boil away together until very tender and thick, stirring very often, then mashing with my potato masher into small chunks.  I would imagine this could be poured into freezer canning containers and frozen successfully longer than a month.  In any case, this one is truly delicious, versatile, and fun to make.  Thanks for the keeper\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I made this Jello salad in a Bundt pan and brought it to a Labor Day picnic.  Everyone was thrilled at the postmodern irony inherent in the Jello mold, plus they all thought it was delicious.  This recipe was just a smidge too big for a 12-cup Bundt pan, so I ended up with about 2 cups of extra Jello in custard cups.  If I do it again, I'll probably do just one package for the top layer (since that's the skinniest part of the Bundt pan).  The very first layer didn't glom on well to the middle layer and as the salad warmed up on the table, the top slid slowly off in slow-motion jiggly lime-green avalanche, which was hilarious.  If you're going to try this in a mold, and you prefer structural integrity to hilarity, I recommend that you start mixing the center layer a bit before the first layer is firm, and add the second layer exactly at the 2-hour mark. I sprayed my pan with non-stick cooking spray, and it just warmed up naturally on the way to the picnic, and it unmolded beautifully.  A fun recipe!  Thanks!\",\n",

The second time we added a second can of green chilies and it was even better.  Last night we made it and I realized I didn't have any chilies and so I added a couple slices of jalepenos and it was still good. Thank you for a fantasic recipe for a favorite of mine.\",\n",

So I just put dollops of the jelly (I used strawberry instead of grape) on top of the pie with some peanuts (please see photo, if interested).  I used the standard Keebler Graham pie crust, and there was way too much filling for my crust - I could have easily filled 2 pie crusts.  I don't know exactly what happened.  I just over-filled my pie crust with the filling as I didn't want to waste it and I didn't have another crust.  Maybe this is supposed to be over-filled?

The texture of the pudding and whipped topping went very well with fruit and crumbled brownie.  The shell hadn't set up hard but was just firm.  The whole thing was very much a delight.

My family doesn't care for raisins, so I substituted 1/4 cup of currants, and added an extra 1/4 cup of apple. I grated the apple in the food processor, so the jam came out looking a bit like marmalade. This jam set up quickly, so I checked it frequently after the lids sealed, and turned the jars 4 or 5 times as they cooled, and the apple distributed beautifully. \\nThanks, DiB's!\",\n",

I followed the recipe exactly, ended up adding 4 cups of whole wheat flour to the dough. Tips for beginners like me - to determine how much flour is enough, your dough should not stick to your hand or countertop, it should peel away from the side of mixing bowl or your hand but still feel a little sticky.  If the dough sticks, add some more flour.  I knead the dough in Kitchen Aid stand mixer at speed 2 for 10 minutes.  another tip for beginners, when kneading your dough in the Kitchenaid mixer, your dough should form a ball/balloon hooked on the hook, moving with the mixer hook, and it should look like a balloon been squeezed between the walls of the mixer bowl and the hook.  For warm water, I used 110F degrees for both sponge and dough. When baking, when the temperature inside the bread reaches about 190-200 degrees it's ready.

The steaming bowl was just sitting under my nose tempting me to eat it first and take a picture of whatever was left. Luckily I was able to hold out. <br/>I chose the crock pot method, but I added the cumin in the begining (by accident) with everything but the sour cream. Also, I added more cilantro (a weakness of mine), broth and red peppers. I added a few dashes of chili powder to add a little spice. I chose to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I put them in whole and frozen & broke them into bite-size pieces right before I added the sour cream.<br/>When I did add the sour cream in the last half hour, I only added half of what the recipe calls for. I added the remainder as dollops in each bowl, garnished with some more chopped cilantro.<br/>We made biscuit nuggets (recipe to be posted shortly) and dipped them in the soup. AWESOME combo!<br/>I have 3 daughters and they all loved it! My 11 y.o. asked if she could take some to school for lunch the next day, adding \"if there\\'s any left over\". My 3 y.o. decided she liked to scoop the soup with the cooked onions as if they were chips and dip (she\\'s never liked onions before) better than she liked eating it with a spoon.

I love Thai, and I love peanut sauces, and this one is a keeper, I also loved how tender the chicken was after being cooked in coconut milk! I topped it with some fresh coriander, which worked great! I was unable to buy any spinach on the day I wanted to cook this, so I just served it in bowls with some brown rice.  The only problem i had with it was I thought there was way too much fish sauce. I had to double all the other sauce ingredients (except the sugar)to get rid of the overpowering fishy taste. Next time I make it, I will only add 1-2 TB of each of the fish sauce & brown sugar. I recommend anyone trying this recipe to just add the fish sauce gradually until you have the taste you like. Great recipe though, and definately one I will make again! PS: Is even better the next day! :) [Made for PRMR]',\n",

It made the most sense to me to add the brown sugar to the pumpkin, spices and salt in step 5, so I added it there.  I'm glad I had all the ingredients pre-measured (as you suggested) otherwise I would have missed adding the sugar altogether.  The filling didn't seem to set completely, which may have been a result of covering the entire pie with aluminum foil while it was baking (which I opted to use because I don't have a crust shield). Your method of baking the pie shell for fifteen minutes really helps maintain a perfectly flaky bottom crust!  I will definately buy a crust shield and continue using this method in the future.\",\n",

This was the perfect balance for us and worked wonderfully. The directions are spot on and the finished product came off splendidly. It is important to let this cool down for an hour or to to allow the caramel time to set up and give a nice crunch to the popcorn (although it smells so good, this is somewhat difficult to achieve, lol).

The instructions were ok except I didn't know if I should treat the Crisco the same as the butter, but I did anyway. Maybe it didn't matter. The taste is good, not wonderful, but good. I probably won't make these again. For a crispy kind of cookie, they're ok.\",\n",

I almost always go for 4 instead of 3 bananas because it does make it extra moist. Note that the extra banana can also make it seem like it’s not cooked through so don’t get caught off guard. Sometimes I need to go over the suggested time in the oven until the toothpick comes out a little cleaner (an extra 5-7 minutes). I like adding a quarter cup of chopped pecans or walnuts into the batter before baking. I’ve made these as muffins and mini-loaves before but maybe my time is off - it’s definitely not as moist in the smaller sizes. The full-sized loaf comes out right every time.',\n",

My husband and 7-yr old son both wolfed them down.  We didn't think we'd like the sauce - it was very thin and yellow compared to restaurant sauce, and I do not like egg yolks.  But it was wonderful, I'll never eat grape leaves out again.  I'd keep the sauce on low-med heat until the dolmas are ready.  It will crust over, but when you whisk it back in, you'll never know.  This keeps it not only hot but a bit thicker.  This recipe called for only 8 oz. jar of leaves, and I had a 16 oz. jar.  I don't know how to store the remainder, so I guess I need to make them again.  Wonder if they freeze well?  Anyway, fabulous recipe that I will repeat.\",\n",

I read the reviews about the dish being on the dry side & considered altering the milk, eggs or adding applesauce, but instead I just baked it in four 6-oz ramekins instead of an 8x8 dish.  I reduced the timing to 20 minutes & they were perfect.  Moist on the inside & slightly firm to crunchy on the top.  The only real changes I made to the recipe were to add about 1/2 cup pomegranate flavored dried cranberries & stirred in the spices instead of sprinkling on top.  I did that because it wasn't actually me making the dish, but my DH & toddler DD.  I stood by, barking out orders & filing my nails.  LOL  This recipe is super easy & breakfast was on the table in less than 30 minutes total.  We're so happy we tried it & made a family affair out of it! :)  Thanks for posting, loof!

Make sure it\\'s real mayo. This will really lighten up the color (it will look similar to guacamole) and add a little \"something\" to the taste. Also using metal utensils tends to darken the color, so try and use only plastic or wood bowls and utensils.\\n\\nWhen I bring eggplants home from the store, I pierce each with a fork several times, put them in the oven on the middle rack, turn the oven to about 400F and leave them to roast for about 1 hr. You can tell they\\'re done if when you insert a fork or knife in them you meet no resistance after you pierce the skin. I usually leave them in the oven to cool, then take them to the sink, peel the skin off, place the eggplant on a cutting board, position it such that the juices drain in the sink and let them drain a little bit. When roasted properly, they should mash easily with a spoon.',\n",

I baked it for 3 1/2 hours and then unwrapped it and shellacked it again and popped it into the oven for another half hour while my sweet potato casserole heated up.  We liked it a lot!  I did feel it needed the lemon to balance the sweet and the vinegar.  Best part, no scrubbing the pan!  Breakfast tomorrow - ham and eggs with hash browns!  Dinner tomorrow - I think a repeat of tonight!  DH loved it!  Thanks!',\n",

I made only 1/4 of it because I knew the kids would not care for the mushrooms and peppers (so I made them regular spagetti and meatballs), but they loved it and just ate around them.  I used 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of light cream.  Next time I will play around with using 1/2 & 1/2 and maybe a little corn starch to thicken, that should cut some calories?  I did use mild turkey sausage, 8 oz fresh sliced mushrooms, 1 yellow pepper, and 4 large roma tomatoes.  It was a definite keeper. Thank!!',\n",

       "  'review': \"Just some tips for making hard candy: Omit corn syrup, can make mixture too hot, causes sugar to scorch. Add one tablespoon of vinegar to every cup of sugar you throw in the pot, this prevents re-crystalization of sugar. Add 2 tablespoons of corn starch. This can help to make the candy less sticky in areas where you deal with high humidity. Add food coloring at 260. Take mixture off heat at 300, let boiling action cease, add flavoring. Stir it in, put a lid on it for a few minutes. Pour candy onto a silicon mat. I place mine inside a cookie sheet. Let this cool off a bit, maybe 10-15 minutes. Once candy has cooled, take cookie sheet and pour off excess oil into sink. You can then pick up and stretch it, then form it into neat shapes, Candy canes too! After a few tugs, you'll get a nice opaque shiny color. Be careful about this, although candy is cool to touch on surface, it is still very hot underneath. Slip on a few disposable gloves to avoid blisters. \",\n",

       "  'review': \"I've been using this recipe for years with only minor modifications.  Cook the bacon over low to med-low heat to render as much grease as possible.  While bacon is cooking, clean and prepare potatoes for boiling.  I cut the potatoes in halves or thirds to make them approximately the same size for even cooking.  In salted water, bring potatoes to a rapid boil for 5 to 10 minutes, cover and turn off heat.  Let sit, covered to finish cooking for 20 - 30 minutes.  I find cooking the potatoes this way, I avoid over cooking and lessen the mush effect of an over cooked exterior. Once bacon is VERY browned and crisp, add 1 large onion - diced and 2 Cups coarsely chopped celery.  Saute until onions are just starting to become transparent.  Remove from heat.  Mix remaining ingredients (I use about 3/4 C sugar and about 1 1/2 C vinegar [cider vinegar offers a nice flavor as well]).  Once well beaten, add to bacon pan, mixing well, return to heat, constantly stirring till thickened.  Combine with sliced potatoes.  Flavor improves over time, so making ahead of time is worth while.  Our family likes it served warm or room temp.\",\n",

My grandmother passed away and my mother had a stroke and couldn't remember how to make it. I was too young when my grandmother was alive to have written the recipe down. We tried many recipes but couldn't find the right mix and proportion of ingredients.\\n\\nI asked my husband to search the net for Tsoureki recipes as Easter was coming up. He found several, but I chose this one because the ingredients looked similar to the ones my grandmother used (particularly the masticha and mahlep).\\n\\nThe bread turned out phenomenally. The loaves truly are enormous. They took the entire width of the oven. The next time I do this recipe, I will likely make six smaller loave instead of the two large ones, as we give Tsoureki to family members for Easter.\\n\\nMy father, not having any faith in me (because I had tried so many recipes in the past), bought eight loves from a Greek bakery and payed close to $10 Canadian per loaf. The consensus of the entire family (including my father) was that of all the bread that anyone had given us or that we had purchased, this recipe was by far the best and truly reminded us all of my grandmother's bread.\\n\\nI must also say that I found this recipe to be virtually foolproof. This was the first time that I had  attempted to make bread in years and it came out perfectly on the first try.\\n\\nMy first cousin, who was raised in Greece even asked for the recipe so that she could pass it on to her Mother-inlaw who spent most of her adult life in Greece.\\n\\nThank you Evelyn for helping helping us recover a cherished family recipe.\\n\\nMary C.

That being said, here's how I make it now. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo 1/3 of the recipe I use 1 tsp lemon extract, 1/2-1 cup raspberries, and the zest of 2 of the three lemons gives it a zing that's nice. I have also used a mixture of lemon and lime juice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, I have made a blueberry cheesecake which was awesome. To the 1/3 of the recipe again I added 1 tsp blueberry extract (Watkins carries this) instead of the lemon, replace the lemon juice with 1 lime juiced and 1/2 cup blueberries when you blend, then I put in 1/2-1 cup whole wild blueberries and folded them in. I made a crust out of pecans, oats, agave nectar, oil, cinnamon and salt.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This was first attempt at making bread in a loaf pan. For such a detailed 38 step recipe, there are some glaring problems. In the ingredients add 1 more egg for the egg wash.Step 29 and 30 are confusing. I thought I was making a loaf of bread - not biscuits!  Dividing dough into thirds making three loafs, experiment! You do not have to make the biscuits. What size loaf pan are we to use? I used 2 - pyrex 8.5x4.5  and a metal one 9x5 or so. The bread didn&#039;t fill any of the pans when done. In the metal one, the loaf came out a lot easier than the pyrex. All three were well buttered. I used very little egg wash and made sure in was only on the top, not dribbling into the pan. And what shelf did you bake in the oven at? I started in what I thought was the middle. At least it was the middle setting. I had to lower the rack, at twenty minutes because the top was golden brown already.I also had a thermometer in the oven, and yes I was baking at 375. I went down to the second rack setting to the bottom, which put the loafs in the middle of the oven. This was on me, now I know better. The bread had great texture, but the crust was too dark and crunchy. When you start out by stating to follow exactly, then give us 38 steps, please give us a recipe without leaving out anything. The bread itself deserves more than two stars but the lengthy instructions missing steps AND the missing egg deserves less than one star. I feel this was a waste of a day in the kitchen.',\n",

I worked with a guy that used to be km at outback and all he would tell me was you just cook them in lots of butter. Though true, much was lacking from his instructions. I&#039;ve made these three times already. And, if you wish you can make them and store them in ziplock bags. Do not refrigerate, they will get soggy. If you make these make extra, people start snacking on them as they are addicting. I would like to say to &quot;chefyeahright&quot; your review is disrespectful. You say you follow the recipe to the letter and then say you tweaked it and made them a second time letting them get stale first. His very first instruction tells you to leave them out overnight, the staler the better. You should remove your review or change your star rating as you did not follow instruction.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks again cold prep guy! My two favorites from outback are the croutons and the ranch dressing. I&#039;m headed out now to buy buttermilk.

In fact, I had the original page out of the McCalls magazine which was in my purse when I got mugged during Christmas time at my neighborhood shopping center. I had the recipe in my purse to gather the ingredients. My purse along with credit cards, money, Christmas cards and this recipe were gone forever as he pulled my purse off my shoulder and ran. I tried to hold onto my purse and was dragged and eventually had to let go.  Anywho, one day I was browsing through a magazine and lo and behold I saw a tiny duplicate of the original recipe.  I took this page and enlarged it as much as I could so I could read the recipe.  This page is wearing out and the print is getting very light so decided to look it up and I&#039;ll be darn I found it here. It is a delicious cake no doubt about it and one of my favorites. The chocolate cakes you get at restaurants are too sickening sweet, too dense and too much glop on top.  A few times the cake layers slid off the whipped cream filling and oh boy I was not happy about that. Another time the cake layer cracked as I put it on the other layer, etc.  This doesn&#039;t happen all the time and I still continue to make this marvelous cake.  I want a piece now.',\n",

I made them exactly per the recipe, with the exception of substituting Baker's Special Milk Powder (mixed with dry ingredients) and water for the milk called for in the original recipe.  As you can see from the photo, the buns rose incredibly high and finished with a nice sheen.  The rise time was spot on for me, as was the bake time, and I love that this is such an uncomplicated recipe--it was remarkably quick with the KitchenAid.  My husband announced that we shall never again purchase store-bought hamburger buns!\",\n",

He would not share with the neighbors, wanted it all for himself...of course he had to share it with me.  It was wonderful, the flavor and texture were spot on.  I used wild jumble berries in this crisp.  A mixture of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and black berries.  Made exactly as written.  Into my keeper box this recipe goes.

I found I didn't have the right size can of tomatoes, so I used approximately half of a 28-oz. can of San Marzano diced tomatoes, which worked out great.  Since I had removed the flesh from the eggplant so well, the shells were really superfluous, since there was really nothing left to them but peel.  I could see using the filling over pasta, too.

If I don't have the ingredients at home then I can stop and pick them up on my way home from work using the express lane and it so easy to remember the ingredients list.  It is warm, gooey, and yummy.  We like to use the mini tator tots.<br/><br/>Updated:  forgot to add stars<br/><br/>2nd update: since the meat is fully cooked you only have to cook this dish for the time listed on the tator tot package.

The tapioca didn't seem to thicken up the juice very much and it might have been because I added some mushrooms to the mix and extra onion.
